<h1 style="color:#D4AF37"> What's the Business Problem? </h1>

The American Energy Market Regulator (AEMR) is responsible for looking after the
United States of America’s domestic energy network. The regulator’s responsibility is to
ensure that America’s energy network remains reliable with minimal disruptions, which
are known as outages. 

There are four key types of outages:

● Consequential

● Forced 

● Opportunistic 

● Planned 

Recently, the AEMR management team has been increasingly aware of a large number
of energy providers that submitted outages over the 2016 and 2017 calendar years. The
management team has expressed a desire to have the following two areas of concern
addressed:

<b> A) Energy Stability and Market Outages
    <p>
B) Energy Losses and Market Reliability </b>`

<h1 style="color:#D4AF37"> Part I. Energy Stability & Market Outages </h1>

<p>
Energy stability is a top priority for the AEMR. To maintain energy security and market reliability, it is critical to understand the patterns and severity of outage events.


## 🔍 Key Business Questions Answered

- What are the most common types of outages, and how long do they typically last?
- How frequently do these outages occur?
- How do outage volumes vary by outage type (Forced, Scheduled, Opportunistic, Consequential) across 2016 and 2017, and what trends or reliability risks emerge over time?
- What are the monthly trends in approved outage events across 2016 and 2017, and which outage types are increasing over time?
- Which participants are responsible for the most frequent and prolonged approved outages by type, and what operational risks do they pose?
- Which participants can be classified as High, Medium, or Low Risk based on their average outage duration, and how can this segmentation inform operational decision-making?


<h1 style="color:#D4AF37"> Part II. Energy Losses & Market Reliability </h1>


As part of a broader initiative to evaluate system resilience, this analysis focuses on **forced outages** to understand their frequency, duration, and overall impact on energy reliability. Given that forced outages are **unplanned supply disruptions**, they present a significant risk to energy security—particularly if multiple providers are affected concurrently.

## 🔍 Key Business Questions Answered

- Which participants pose the greatest operational risk based on the frequency and average duration (in days) of their forced outages?
- What proportion of all outages in 2016 and 2017 were classified as Forced Outages?
- What was the average duration of a forced outage in each of those years, and has the duration increased over time?
- What are the primary causes behind the highest energy losses for the top three participants (GW, MELK, AURICON), and how much do these outage reasons contribute to their overall energy loss?
