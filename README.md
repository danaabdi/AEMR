<h1 style="color:#D4AF37"> What's the Business Problem? </h1>

The American Energy Market Regulator (AEMR) is responsible for looking after the
United States of America’s domestic energy network. The regulator’s responsibility is to
ensure that America’s energy network remains reliable with minimal disruptions, which
are known as outages. 

There are four key types of outages:

● Consequential

● Forced 

● Opportunistic 

● Planned 

Recently, the AEMR management team has been increasingly aware of a large number
of energy providers that submitted outages over the 2016 and 2017 calendar years. The
management team has expressed a desire to have the following two areas of concern
addressed:

<b> A) Energy Stability and Market Outages
    <p>
B) Energy Losses and Market Reliability </b>`

<h1 style="color:#D4AF37"> Part I. Energy Stability & Market Outages </h1>

<p>
Energy stability is a top priority for the AEMR. To maintain energy security and market reliability, it is critical to understand the patterns and severity of outage events.
Key questions driving this analysis include:

<p>
<b>
<li>  What are the most common types of outages, and how long do they typically last?
<li>  How frequently do these outages occur?
<li>  Are certain energy providers consistently more prone to outages, signaling potential systemic reliability risks?
    
<p>

<h1 style="color:#D4AF37"> Part II. Energy Losses & Market Reliability </h1>

### Objective

As part of a broader initiative to evaluate system resilience, this analysis focuses on **forced outages** to understand their frequency, duration, and overall impact on energy reliability. Given that forced outages are **unplanned supply disruptions**, they present a significant risk to energy security—particularly if multiple providers are affected concurrently.

To support AEMR’s efforts in mitigating these risks, the analysis addresses the following key business questions:

- **What proportion of all outages in 2016 and 2017 were classified as Forced Outages?**
- **What was the average duration of a forced outage in each of those years, and has the duration increased over time?**
- **Which energy providers recorded the highest number of forced outages, and do any patterns indicate systemic reliability issues?**
