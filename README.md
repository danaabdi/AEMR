<h1 style="color:#D4AF37"> What's the Business Problem? </h1>

The American Energy Market Regulator (AEMR) is responsible for looking after the
United States of America’s domestic energy network. The regulator’s responsibility is to
ensure that America’s energy network remains reliable with minimal disruptions, which
are known as outages. 

There are four key types of outages:

● Consequential

● Forced 

● Opportunistic 

● Planned 

Recently, the AEMR management team has been increasingly aware of a large number
of energy providers that submitted outages over the 2016 and 2017 calendar years. The
management team has expressed a desire to have the following two areas of concern
addressed:

<b> A) Energy Stability and Market Outages
    <p>
B) Energy Losses and Market Reliability </b>`
